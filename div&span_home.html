                My name is <b><i>Navaneeth H Krishnan, 19 years old</i></b>. I hail from <b><i>Anchalumoodu in the district of Kollam, Kerala</i></b>. 
                I completed my matriculation in <i>The Kings’ School, Kollam</i> in the IGCSE syllabus. Afterwards, I attended the <i>Kuriakose Elias English Medium School in Kottayam</i> 
                for my high school diploma in Science (Computer Science). From childhood, I have been known for being extroverted and talking to strangers freely and openly, so the opportunity 
                to stay at a hostel for my high school was a very steep learning curve and an exciting journey for me.

                I have always seen Engineering as a life’s dream, hence I wrote the prestigious <b><i>VITEEE exam</i></b> 
                and received admission into the esteemed <b>Vellore Institute of Technology</b> to pursue <i>Majors in Computer Science Engineering</i>. 
                This college has introduced me to a whole variety of culture, technology, and learning. I am able to interact with experienced faculty, 
                meet people from all cultures, and take my dreams forward.

                I am part of the <b>RoboVITics club</b> at VIT, which has given me a purpose in this college, and I am very interested 
                in programming and studying web development from <b>Sathya Ma’am</b>. She teaches very nicely, and I'm excited to learn more 
                about the subject from her—fingers crossed for this semester. By the end of four years, I hope to pursue further studies outside India, 
                but I am still deciding on which universities to apply to. I am learning all the intricacies.
