	I completed mumatriculation in The Kings’ Schhool, Kollam in the IGCSE syllabus. Afterwards I attended the <i>Kuriakose Elias English Medium School in Kottayam</i> 
	for my high school diploma in Scienc(Computer Science). From childhood, I have been known for being extroverted and talking to strangers freely and openly so the opportunity to stay at a hostel for my high school 
was a very steep learning curve and an exciting journey for me.</font> </p>

	and received adission into the esteemed <b>Vellore Instittute of Technology</b> to pursue <i>Majors in Computer Science Engineering</i>. This college has introduced me to a whole variety of culture,
	technology and learning. I am able to interact with experienced faculty, interact with people from all cultures and take my dreams forward.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="3.7" face="Verdana" color='light green'>I am part of the <b>RoboVITics club</b> at VIT which has given me a purpose in this college and I am very intersted 
		in programming and studying web development from <b>Sathya Ma’am</b>.She teaches very nicely and I'm very interested in getting to learn more about the subject from her, fingers crossed for this sem. By the end of four years, I hope to
	pursue further studies outside India but I am still deiciding on which universities to apply to, I am still learning all the intricacies.</font></p>
